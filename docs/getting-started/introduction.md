[Kvell.js](https://www.github.com/nsharma1396/kvell) is a family of packages using which you can create Node.js applications with pre-defined
configurations, a fixed application flow and a set of abstractions. It bootstraps the node application with a set of popularly used npm packages and provides a minimal setup environment so that the developer can focus directly on writing the essential parts of the application.

It composes applications with a focus on:

- Maintaining a proper code standard.
- Abstracting out server configurations.
- Abstracting out database related configurations.
- A consistent top-level folder structure.
- Support for writing API documentations without any setups.
- Auto-template creation for routes and models.
- Automatic git initialization on project setup.
- A simple logging mechanism.

`Kvell` takes inspiration from [create-react-app](https://www.create-react-app.dev) in it's implementation and shares some similarity with `create-react-app's` methodology and internal flow when it comes to how it works under the hood.
