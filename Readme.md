# Kvell.js

## What is Kvell ?

[Kvell.js](https://www.github.com/nsharma1396/kvell) is a family of packages using which you can create Node.js applications with pre-defined
configurations, a fixed application flow and a set of abstractions. It bootstraps the node application with a set of popularly used npm packages and provides a minimal setup environment so that the developer can focus directly on writing the essential parts of the application.

## What does it do ?

- Maintains a proper code standard.
- Abstracts out server configurations.
- Abstracts out database related configurations.
- Maintains a consistent top-level folder structure.
- Provides support for writing and viewing API documentations without any setups.
- Provides auto-template creation for routes and models.
- Does automatic git initialization (if possible) on project setup.
- Provides a very simple and basic logging mechanism.

`Kvell` takes inspiration from [create-react-app](https://www.create-react-app.dev) in it's implementation and shares some similarity with `create-react-app's` methodology and internal flow when it comes to how it works under the hood.
