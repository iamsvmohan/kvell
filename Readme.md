# Kvell.js

Kvell creates Node.js applications with pre-defined configurations, app flow and abstractions.

It composes applications with a strong focus on:
- [x] Consistent folder structure
- [x] Code standards
- [x] Abstracting out server and db configurations
- [x] Multiple db availability
- [x] Api documentation
- [x] Auto-template creation
- [x] Automatic git initialization
- [x] Logging

It tries to follow the "Twelve-factor app" methodology and will probably follow it in a much more improved manner with upcoming versions.

Kvell gives you access to scripts that run your applications in `development`, `testing` and `production` environments.

Kvell is currently in *beta* and the current status of the scripts pipeline is:

- [x] Development
- [ ] Testing
- [ ] Build

Docs are under development and will be updated soon.
